# Production Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Analysis
The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'S')" typically occurs due to:
1. Missing environment variables
2. React context provider issues in production
3. Over-aggressive code minification
4. Missing dependencies in production build

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Error Boundaries
- Added comprehensive error boundary in `main.jsx`
- Added global error handlers for unhandled promises
- Fallback UI for when components fail to load

### 2. Improved Context Providers
- Added default values to React contexts
- Added fallback returns when contexts are used outside providers
- Improved error handling in context hooks

### 3. Updated Vite Configuration
- Reduced aggressive optimizations that could break code
- Disabled unsafe terser optimizations
- Kept console.error for production debugging
- Added better rollup warning handling

### 4. Simplified App Component
- Removed complex auto-reload logic that could cause issues
- Simplified loading states
- Removed potentially problematic loading overlays

## Deployment Steps

1. **Clean Build**
   ```bash
   cd client/kala-sangam
   rm -rf node_modules dist
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   Ensure these are set in production:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   VITE_API_URL=your_api_url
   ```

3. **Test Build Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   Upload the `dist` folder to your hosting provider

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for specific error messages
2. **Check Network Tab**: Ensure all assets are loading
3. **Try Different Browsers**: Rule out browser-specific issues
4. **Check Server Configuration**: Ensure proper mime types and routing

## Emergency Fallback

If the site still doesn't work, try building without:
- Remove React.StrictMode from main.jsx (line 83-85)
- Set minify: false in vite.config.js
- Add sourcemap: true to vite.config.js for debugging

## Common Production Issues

1. **Routing Issues**: Ensure server has proper fallback to index.html
2. **Asset Loading**: Check that all static assets are accessible
3. **CORS Issues**: Verify API endpoints work from production domain
4. **Memory Issues**: Large bundle sizes causing memory problems

## Build Verification

After building, check that:
- [ ] No error messages in build output
- [ ] All critical CSS is included
- [ ] No missing dependencies warnings
- [ ] Bundle size is reasonable (< 5MB total)
