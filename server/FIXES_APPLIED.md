# Authentication and Verification Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Profile Access Issue ✅
**Problem**: When clicking on admin profile, it was redirecting to login even though the user was logged in.

**Root Cause**: The `/api/auth/me` endpoint was returning `null` for the user data due to:
- Auth middleware inconsistency in setting `req.user.userId` vs `req.user.id`
- The `getMe` controller wasn't properly handling both property variations

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated auth middleware to set both `userId` and `id` properties for compatibility
- Fixed `getMe` controller to check for both `req.user.userId` and `req.user.id`
- Improved error handling and response structure

### 2. Verification System Access Issue ✅
**Problem**: Verification endpoints were not working properly for admin users.

**Root Cause**: 
- Middleware composition issues in verification routes
- Auth middleware not properly setting user properties

**Fix Applied**:
- Fixed middleware composition in verification routes
- Replaced `adminOnly` middleware with inline admin role checks for better error handling
- Removed duplicate admin checks in controller methods
- Ensured consistent auth middleware behavior

### 3. Email Verification Token Issues ✅
**Problem**: Email verification tokens were not being validated correctly.

**Root Cause**: The `generateEmailVerificationToken` method was hashing tokens before storing them, but the verification endpoint wasn't hashing the incoming token for comparison.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `verifyEmail` controller to hash the incoming token before database lookup
- Added proper token expiration checking
- Fixed token cleanup after successful verification

## Files Modified

1. **`middleware/auth.js`**
   - Enhanced user object structure in auth middleware
   - Added both `userId` and `id` properties for compatibility
   - Improved error handling

2. **`controllers/auth.controller.js`**
   - Fixed `getMe` endpoint to handle both user ID property variations
   - Updated `verifyEmail` method to properly hash and validate tokens
   - Improved error responses and user data structure

3. **`controllers/verificationController.js`**
   - Removed duplicate admin role checks (now handled in routes)
   - Streamlined controller methods

4. **`routes/verificationRoutes.js`**
   - Replaced generic `adminOnly` middleware with inline admin checks
   - Improved error messaging for admin access

## Testing Results

All endpoints now work correctly:
- ✅ Admin login successful
- ✅ `/api/auth/me` endpoint returns proper user data
- ✅ Admin can access verification endpoints:
  - `/api/verification/pending` - View pending verification requests
  - `/api/verification/stats` - View verification statistics
  - `/api/verification/status` - View user verification status
  - `/api/verification/review/:targetUserId` - Approve/reject verifications

## Verification System Features

The verification system now supports:
- Artists can submit verification requests
- Admins can view pending verification requests
- Admins can approve or reject verification requests
- Verification statistics for admin dashboard
- Proper role-based access control
- Email verification for new user accounts

## Security Improvements

- Proper token validation for email verification
- Role-based access control for admin functions
- Consistent authentication middleware
- Improved error handling to prevent information leakage
