# Admin Panel - Now Working! 🎉

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

1. **API Route Mismatch**: Fixed the HTTP method mismatch between client (PUT) and server (PATCH)
2. **Response Format**: Updated server responses to match client expectations
3. **Status Mapping**: Fixed status value mapping between frontend and backend
4. **Test Data**: Created test reports in the database for testing
5. **Server Routes**: Corrected API endpoint paths

## 🚀 **How to Test the Admin Panel:**

### 1. Start the Servers:

**Backend Server (if not running):**
```bash
cd server
node server.js
```

**Frontend Server:**
```bash
cd client/kala-sangam
npm run dev
```

### 2. Login to Admin Panel:

1. **Go to**: `http://localhost:5174` (or your frontend URL)
2. **Click**: "Login" in navigation
3. **Click**: "🔐 Login as Admin" button
4. **Admin Login**:
   - Email: `admin@test.com`
   - Password: `admin123`

### 3. Test Admin Features:

#### **Reports Management** (Main functionality):
- ✅ View all reports (4 test reports created)
- ✅ Filter by status (All, Pending, Approved, Rejected)
- ✅ See statistics (Total, Pending, Approved, Rejected counts)

- ✅ Approve/Reject reports with admin notes

#### **Dashboard Navigation**:

## 📊 **Test Reports Available:**

The system now has 4 test reports:
1. **Inappropriate Content** (Pending) - Ready for review
2. **Spam** (Pending) - Ready for review  
3. **Harassment** (Resolved) - Already reviewed
4. **Hate Speech** (Dismissed) - Already reviewed

## 🧪 **Testing Workflow:**

4. **Review Report**: Click "Review" on a pending report
5. **Make Decision**: Approve or reject with admin notes
6. **Verify Update**: Check that status changes and stats update

## ⚡ **Quick Test Commands:**

If you want to verify backend directly:

```bash
# Check if reports endpoint works (need valid token from login)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5050/api/reports/stats" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## 🔧 **Technical Fixes Applied:**
