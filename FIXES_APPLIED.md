# TRADITIONAL-ARTS Project Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved âœ…

### 1. **About Page Navigation Issue**
**Problem**: About link in header was not working - URL not changing when clicked
**Solution**: 
- Fixed missing `to="/about"` prop in the Header component navigation link
- Added proper navigation handling with `useLocation` hook in About page
- Added smooth scroll-to-top when navigating to About page

**Files Modified**:
- `client/kala-sangam/src/components/Header.jsx` (Line 188)
- `client/kala-sangam/src/pages/About.jsx` (Added useLocation import and navigation handling)

### 2. **Art Gallery Cards Display Issue**
**Problem**: Only 3 cards showing instead of all 103 available artforms
**Solution**: 
- **Root Cause**: Backend server was not running (port 5050)
- Started the backend server successfully
- Fixed CSS layout issues that were preventing proper grid display
- Updated grid layout from `md:grid-cols-3` to `lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4`
- Removed `max-width` constraint from `ArtFormCard` component
- Fixed CSS class naming issues (`teal-blue` â†’ `tealblue` to match Tailwind config)

**Files Modified**:
- `client/kala-sangam/src/pages/ArtGallery.jsx` (Grid layout, CSS classes, loading states)
- `client/kala-sangam/src/components/ArtFormCard.jsx` (Removed max-width constraint, improved layout)
