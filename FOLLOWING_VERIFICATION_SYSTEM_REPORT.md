## 🔄 User Flows

### Following System User Flow
1. **User discovers artist** → Views artist profile
2. **Clicks follow button** → `FollowButton` component calls API
3. **API processes request** → Updates both users' following/followers arrays
4. **UI updates** → Button shows "Following" state
5. **User can view lists** → `FollowingLists` component shows following/followers

### Verification System User Flow
1. **Artist requests verification** → Submits documents via form
2. **Admin reviews request** → Uses `VerificationAdmin` component
3. **Admin approves/rejects** → Updates user's verification status
4. **Verification badge shows** → `VerificationBadge` appears on profiles
5. **Public can see verified artists** → Listed in verified artists section

## 🎨 UI Components Integration

### For Users
- **Artist Profiles:** Show follow buttons and verification badges
- **User Dashboard:** Can access following/followers lists
- **Artist Lists:** Filter by verified status

### For Admins
- **Admin Panel:** Complete verification management interface
- **Statistics Dashboard:** View verification stats and pending requests
- **User Management:** Review and process verification requests

## 🔐 Security & Authentication

- ✅ **Following endpoints** require user authentication
- ✅ **Verification submission** requires user authentication  
- ✅ **Admin verification routes** require admin role
- ✅ **Public routes** work without authentication (verified artists list)
- ✅ **CORS properly configured** for cross-origin requests
